VS CODE IS REQUIRED FOR DEBUGGING TO WORK!

Make sure to install gdb for debugging purposes ( if gdb is not installed run sudo apt install gdb , if this
does not work use the --fix-missing )

To run the program make sure to build it using control+shift+b to build the file you have opened , and press F5 to run it ( note that you can only
have one debugger active )

If you don't have VS Code just do it the good ol' fashion way ( gcc server -o server.c etc ...)
